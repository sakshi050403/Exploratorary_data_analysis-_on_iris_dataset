This repository contains an analysis of the Iris dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics,
containing measurements of iris flowers with the aim of classifying them into three different species based on their attributes.
The notebook Iris_dataset.ipynb explores various aspects of the Iris dataset, including data visualization and statistical analysis.

Project Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The goal is to classify each sample into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.
This project involves:
Loading and exploring the dataset
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Visualizing data distributions and relationships
